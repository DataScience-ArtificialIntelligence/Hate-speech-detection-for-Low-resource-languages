# Hate-speech-detection-for-Low-resource-languages

## Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models for automatic hate speech detection in low-resource languages, focusing on addressing the challenges posed by limited availability of labeled training data and linguistic tools.

## Objective
The aim of the project is to Develop machine learning models tailored for hate speech detection in low-resource languages. Utilizes fine-tuning of pre-trained language models like BERT for hate speech detection.
